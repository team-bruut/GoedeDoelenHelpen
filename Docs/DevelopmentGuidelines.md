# Development Guidelines

## Code

### Architecture

- Architecture must be obeyed when realising the designs.
- Design patterns must be used effectively and according to their purpose.
- If code realisation of a design has any deviation from the design, it must be reflected in an updated version of the design.

### Language

- Use language convention and naming (IE: CamelCase).
- Avoid improper or unclear naming.
- Functions must serve one clear purpose.
- Classes must not be a Swiss Army Knife (IE: Class Utils).

### Testing

- Code must pass all tests before commiting.
- New code elligible for testing must have appropriate tests included before commiting.



## GitHub

### Branching

- Branch names must always be in lower Camel Case.
- The Master Branch is protected from direct commits and can only be commited to via a pull request.

```
- master 
  - develop
    - loginRefactor
    - ...
```

### Commits

- Commit titles must include the subject of the change featured in the commit.
- Commits must always include a clear and concise description.
- Commits must be as small as possible.
- Commit frequently rather than one "big" commit at once.

### Pull Requests
- Pull Requests must be as small as possible.
