## Back-end
The back-end is created in ASP.NET core with the programming language C#.

Our primary focus within ASP.net will be on the Web API https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/02/27/asp-net-core-2-1-web-apis/ for new techniques. Other documentation is found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api

### use of swagger.io
The documentation from the web api is visible by running the project and visit https://baseurl/swagger

A client can be generated by opening the `nswag.nswag` file with `NSwagStudio` be sure the run the project when using the tool. 

a manual to install NSwagStudio can be found here: https://github.com/RSuter/NSwag/wiki/NSwagStudio 

## Frontend
The frontend application is created in React typescript using the template: https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter 

The frontend is served by asp.net using a proxy to the frontend server.

For routing within the frontend application `react-router` is used. Documentation can be found at: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/philosophy
